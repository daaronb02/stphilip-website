This year we launch a brand new website, bringing our Church into the 2020s with a fully updated graphical design and sitemap. New features include an updated About us page with bios for our three clergy. We have a page for bulletins and news updates, as well as an additional page where homilies will be posted. Future improvements include adding back the gallery section from the old site to share pictures of Church activities, as well as updates to the calendar. We hope you enjoy!

P.S. The website theme and cover image will change to match the liturgical calendar's feasts and seasons. We encourage you to check in over the course of the year.
